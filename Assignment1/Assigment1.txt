#1: Make a directory Assignment1 under your home directory and change it. All your homework for this assignment will be done there.

cd cs131/
mkdir Assignment1
cd Assignment1/
touch Assignment1.txt

#2: Echo your current Shell using the global variable and paste the output of the command.  Which commands did you use?

echo $SHELL
/bin/bash

#3: Echo your home directory path and paste the output of the command.  Which commands did you use?

echo $HOME

#4: What is your UID?  To what group(s) do you belong?  How did you find out (command used)?

uid=1122(benjaminf23) gid=1122(benjaminf23) groups=1122(benjaminf23),77(S77)
My UID is 1122(benjaminf23) and I belong to group 77.
I used id to find my UID and group.

#5: Create a new directory "myDir" under the Assignment 1 folder. Now remove "write" permission for yourself.(see chmod man page) 

From this temp directory, are you allowed to cd in that directory? Can you "ls" it?  Can you "ls -l" it? Can you create files under it?

mkdir myDir
chmod -w myDir

Nothing happens when I try to ls the directory. ls -l outputs total 0. I cannot create any new files under myDir

#6: Create a new directory "myDir2" and create a new directory "myDir3" 

mkdir myDir2 myDir3

#7: Inside myDir2, create a file "myFile.txt" (use 'touch' or 'vi' command). Once done, move this file from myDir2 to myDir3 using the mv command.

touch myDir2/myFile.txt
mv myDir2/myFile.txt myDir3/
